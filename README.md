# A little insight into Sarah Guthals

Hi Everyone! My name is Sarah Guthals and I am the author of `GitHub for Dummies`. This README will give you a bit of
information about me.

## My Career Passions
I really love working in tech. Specifically, I love being in a position where I can help others build something amazing!
Whether that's being a manager, or working with customers and relaying that information back to the developers, that is my
sweet spot! I enjoy teaching and learning, so any role that enables me to flex my education muscles is the right role for
me, that's why I really enjoy writing these books!

## My Hobbies
On of my favorite thing to do is to go to Disneyland - even if I didn't go to any rides, just walking around the park and
feeling the magic is enough for me. :smile:
